- Collections returned by workable API are now paginated - that enforced introducing
new `Workable::Collection` class that holds `data` (jobs/candidates) and reference
to next page of results.

- `jobs` method does not set default `stage` argument - please specify it explicitly!
Also - now it accepts a hash as more parameters are available in v3 API
